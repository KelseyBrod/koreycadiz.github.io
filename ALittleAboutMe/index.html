    <p> <b> Name: </b> Korey Cadiz </p>
    <p> <b> Age:</b> 19 </p>
    <p> <b> Origin: </b> Maui, Hawaii </p>
    <p> <b> Occupation: </b> Undergraduate Student at Duke University (Sophomore) </p>
    <p> <b> Area(s) of Focus: </b> Pre-med; Biology and Evolutionary Anthropology
    </p><p> <b> Why Coding?:</b> This is the first <em> legitimate </em> code I have ever constructed in my entire life. I had no interest in learning it in high school, and by the time I entered college, I had to prioritize other classes. Since I can't focus on computer science, I figured that knowing the basics of coding and being able to create my own website would be a valuable skill that I could use for various projects and interests in the future. </p>
    <p> <b> Favorite Color: </b> Forest Green </p>
    <p> <b> Favorite Food: </b> I have many favorite foods, and they all vary by what I'm craving that day. Generally, I have a very persistent sweet tooth, and I love fresh fish, rice, and noodles. </p>
    <p> <b> Hopes and Dreams: </b> Since I'm pre-med, it can be understood that I have many dreams, which are consistently <strong> slammed </strong> as I continue on this track. I hope to become a surgeon. As far as what type of surgeon, it is far too soon to tell, but I am currently intrigued by orthopedics. To fulfill this goal requires a lot of dream-crushing work, all of which I'm eager yet <strong>terrified</strong> to approach. I have a genuine and personal interest in studying medicine and treating patients surgically, but I would be lying if the high income was not a great consideration. With that being said, I have very high hopes for my future and am constantly doubting my abilities to achieve it. Of course, I will continue to try my best, but worst case scenario (<em>me failing</em>), I will simply own many dogs to care for my depression and probably teach biology at a high school. </p>
    <p> <b> Astrological Sign:</b> Cancer </p>
    <p> <b> Favorite Pet:</b> Dog </p>
    <small> <i> My favorite dogs include: 
      <li> Poodles </li>
      <li> Pitbulls </li> 
      <li> Dachshunds </li> </i> </small>
      <p> <b> Favorite Animal: </b> Squirrel </p> </code>
