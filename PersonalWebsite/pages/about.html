          <br>
          <h4> This was created for a class project, but I have always wanted to code my own website, so I intend to use this for storing information about myself, my projects, and a way to contact me. I've always wanted a portfolio such as this, and since I have recently learned how to code, this is a great opportunity for me to track my progress and maintain all my creations in one place. </h4>
          <br>
          <h4> My name is Korey Cadiz, and I am from Maui, Hawaii. I am native to the area, so I was raised with a unique perspective of Hawaiian culture and education. This was the main purpose behind me learning how to code. I wanted a personal website, but there are many ways to do that online. I am not the most artistic person, but creating these sites is a way for me to express my roots and myself. </h4>
          <br>
          <h4> I do have a life outside of this website, which consists of me working my butt off to get into a medical school and eventually become a doctor (preferabbly a surgeon, but I have a lot of time to fully decide). Outside of the academic grind, I enjoy tutoring English to foreigners online and volunteering in support of people's rights, safety, and health. More information about this can be find in "Projects". </h4>
          <br>
          <h4> In my personal life, I enjoy (trying to) read romance books and exercise in a variety of ways. It is a constant work in progress. The things that come more naturally include spending time with friends and family, obsessing over dogs, watching shows and movies, and of course, sleeping. If you ever see me out and about, I am most likely dressed in leggings and a hoodie, because I strongly believe that living in comfort is optimal. </h4>
          <br>
          <h4> I think that's quite a lot to read, so if you want to learn more about me, you can reach out to me in "Contact". Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the site and respective projects! </h4>
